## remo.tv is an open telerobotics platform designed for controling and sharing control of robots online in real time.

##EV3dev guide
Install ev3dev on your ev3 and establish an SSH connection before proceeding.
Guides for this are at [ev3dev.org](https://ev3dev.org)


1. Install the required software libraries and tools. Make sure you donâ€™t get any errors in the console when doing the step below. If you have an issue, you can run this line again, and that will usually fix it!

   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install ffmpeg python-serial python-dev libgnutls28-dev espeak python-smbus python-pip git
   ```

2. Download the remotv control scripts from our github

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanGamingTV/ev3-controller.git ~/remotv
   ```

3. Install python requirements

   ```sh
   sudo python -m pip install -r ~/remotv/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the new `remotv` directory

   ```sh
   cd remotv
   ```

5. Copy `controller.sample.conf` to `controller.conf`

   ```sh
   cp controller.sample.conf controller.conf
   ```

## Configure the controller

1. Edit the `controller.conf` file created in the previous section.
   ```sh
   nano controller.conf
   ```
2. Configure the `[robot]` section

   - `owner` should be the username you have registered the robot under on the remo.tv site.
   - `robot_key` is the API key for your robot that you made on the site.
      - Your API key is LONG. It should look something like `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6InJib3QtNTVjZjJmMjUtNjBhNS00ZDJkLTk5YzMtOGZmOGRiYWU4ZDQ1IiwiaWF0IjoxNTczNTExMDA2LCJzdWIiOiIifQ.LGXSBSyQ4T4X5xU_w3QJD6R3lLjrrkw_QktOIDzRW5U`. If it is not this long, you have not copied the full key.
      
## Starting up
SSH into your robot, and make sure it has internet access.
Navigate into the ~/remotv folder
```sh
cd ~/remotv
```
Then run this
```sh
brickrun -- echo YOURLINUXPASSWORDHERE | python3 controller.py
```
